**Environmental justice for Pacoima: Seeking alternative land use for Whiteman Airport**

My project will spatialize public health and environmental raw data for the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacoima, a working-class community where 85% of residents are Latinx and 7% are Black. A total of $57 million will be injected into the community for green infrastructure investments from Californiaâ€™s Cap-and-Trade through the Transformative Climate Communities (TCC) program. Closing the Whiteman Airport and repurposing the site is a chief objective to further racial and economic justice for the community.
