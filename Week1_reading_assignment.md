**LA City Council wants Pacoima’s Whiteman Airport to close**

The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously on December 9, 2020 on a resolution to close the 182-acre Whiteman Airport in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacoima. In addition to community safety, environmental and economic justice concerns galvanized community members to call for the airport’s closure and led to the resolution. The city will conduct an environmental analysis and an economic analysis of the airport site to evaluate potential uses.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s database shows that Whiteman Airport has had 15 aviation crashes since 2009; how does Whiteman Airport’s airplane crash rate compare with other airports of the same size? While statistics are crucial for assessing air traffic safety, the trauma from the crash on November 12, 2020 of a single-engine plane that killed the pilot and scorched several cars left indelible scars in the community. The absence of more robust crash data in this case did not detract from the community’s insistence, as voiced by the community-based organization Pacoima Beautiful, on closing the airport. A single horrific crash precipitated the Council’s vote. My research, however, seeks to investigate the environmental impact of the airport on the community. This could consist of comparing rates of asthma in the Pacoima neighborhood to other Los Angeles neighborhoods without airports.
